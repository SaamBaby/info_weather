 ### Notes  
No important notes that to be aware of, just a simple application that show the weather.For your
 convenience I am attaching a screenshot of all the pages
 
 ### Date 
27-May-2021
### Time spent
I spend  3 and half hours yesterday (26-May-2021)  from 10:00 to 1:45  making the  UI screens in
 Figma and went through the open weather API  and came up with the possible challenges while developing the application. And from morning 7 30 – 1:00, I worked on the API calls, JSON serialization, and backend Logic. Followed by  6 hours from 3 to 9 developing the front-end and database. So all together around 10 to 11 hours in total.
### Assumptions made 
One of the worst assumptions I made yesterday was that  I could be easily satisfied with the UI on my first try and won't have to redo it again so that I could concentrate more on the functionality and more testing. But it turned out to be the biggest mistake that cost me a lot of time.
### Shortcuts/Compromises
As I have progressed through the assignment I had to make minor compromises, but the important one was that I decided to keep my app simple.
At the initial stage, I have planned to implement 3d and interactive animations and use bloc pattern, but as when dug deep into each and every aspects, I found it a bit overwhelming and decided to stick to simple colors and use providers for state management.

### Why did you choose the technology/framework you used? What were your considerations behind the technology/framework chosen?
I believe Flutter is the future of cross-platform development technologies, Unlike react native and other native languages I have used, I found flutter more flexible and has better performance. The most important factor is that I find it really comfortable and relaxing to code flutter, even if it's for hours. 

### Stretch goals attempted
As I have mentioned before even though bloc is an important aspect, I skipped it to save time, And in the morning I spend a considerably substantial amount of time trying to build custom Rave animations for the app since I couldn’t find what I planned for. Since I lost a great deal of my time in the morning trying to figure things out, I decided to quit the try and redid the whole UI.

### What do you wish you could have done better?
Right now I wish if I could have stuck with my initial plan and maybe build some more
 functionalities, made more animations, make the app more reactive 
### Were you short on time and not able to include something that you want us to know about?
I didn’t know the time limit so, I was trying to complete everything as much as I could. If have some more time, I could have worked some more with the Api.
### Feedback on this technical challenge
The challenge was good.
 ### Have feedback on how we could make this assignment better? Please let us know
For me personally, a heads up would have been great, because I was not expecting a call, nor was I prepared for anything. But with God’s grace, I could finish as much as I could
